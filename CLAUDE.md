# Your harness

This file is yours, and it arrives empty on purpose. The rules you hold the
agent to are part of what gets marked, so they should be rules you decided on.

Nothing about the template is recorded here. What the repo ships is explained
where it lives --- `fly.toml`, the `Dockerfile`, the CI workflow and
`spec/README.md` each say what they fix --- and the course website publishes the
[final project brief](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp4020-agentic-coding-studio/assessments/final-project/).
What the agent needs to carry from any of it is your call.

## This project: a persistent insect colony

Long-term concept: a persistent multiplayer insect colony — queen, workers,
territory, evolution, predators, multiple worlds. Each crit is a deliberately
thin slice on top of the last, not a rewrite. Crit 8's slice: one world, one
colony, gather, reproduce, SQLite persistence.

- **No realtime until Crit 9.** `ws` is a dependency so adding it later is
  additive, not a migration, but don't import or wire it up just because
  it's installed — WebSockets/SSE are explicitly out of scope until then.
- **"Good" means consequential, not just coexisting.** `README.md`'s
  definition of good says multiplayer should change the shared world, not
  just put two people's cursors in the same room. Keep that in mind once
  Crit 9 adds other players: prefer state shaped so one player's actions are
  visible to another (one colony, one set of resource nodes) over anything
  that quietly partitions the world per visitor.
- **The server is the sole source of truth.** Every gather/reproduce outcome
  is computed server-side; the client only ever renders what `GET
  /api/state` returns, never a locally-computed guess. This is what keeps
  adding realtime/multiplayer later additive instead of a rewrite.
- **Everything the "still there on reload" promise depends on lives in
  SQLite**, not server memory and not the browser. If it matters after a
  restart, it's a column.
- **One global colony/world for now.** No accounts, no per-visitor identity.
  Don't add auth prematurely — that's a Crit 9+ concern tied to multiplayer.
- **No frontend framework.** Plain TypeScript + DOM, bundled with esbuild.
- **Balance constants** (gather yield, reproduce cost, world size) live in
  `src/server/balance.ts`, never as inline literals — they get tuned.
- **`node:24-slim`, not `-alpine`**, in the Dockerfile. `better-sqlite3`'s
  prebuilt binaries have solid glibc coverage; musl often forces a
  from-source compile. Don't switch base images without re-checking this.
- **The server runs straight from `.ts` source** (Node's native type
  stripping — see `tsconfig.json`'s comments). Only the client needs a
  build step (`pnpm build:client`, esbuild). Don't add a server build step
  or a `dist/server/` output; `CMD` runs `src/server/index.ts` directly.
